Native class syntax has been an emerging standard in Javascript for some time
now. With features like class fields, private methods and fields, and decorators
on the way, pretty soon Javascript will have a fully featured class syntax with
capabilities that havenâ€™t been available in the language before. While Ember.js
has had its own trusty custom object-model since the very beginning, these
broader advancements are going to be the future of the language and the web, and
Ember has begun planning to transition to using them as the default.

Ember Decorators is a project dedicated to exploring and unlocking that future.
Its goal is to provide a set of decorators which can be used to write native
classes with every standard feature that is available in Ember, along with the
transforms and build system required to polyfill and ship them in your app
