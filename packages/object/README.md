Ember Decorators began as a project dedicated to exploring and unlocking the 
future of native classes in Ember.js. Now, that future is here! Decorators will
be landing soon in Ember, and there is a [polyfill available for 
them](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-decorators-polyfill).

This library now contains a few extra decorators which were not upstreamed to 
Ember, and may still be useful to some users. Check out the [documentation 
website](https://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators) for detailed API 
documentation for all the decorators included in this addon.
