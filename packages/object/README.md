Ember Decorators is a project dedicated to exploring and unlocking the future
of native classes in Ember.js. Its goal is to provide a set of decorators which
can be used to write native classes with every standard feature that is
available in Ember, along with the transforms and build system required to
polyfill and ship them in your app today!

This addon contains decorators related to Ember Objects in general. Checkout the
[documentation website](https://ember-decorators.github.io/ember-decorators)
for detailed guides on using native classes with Ember today, along with
detailed API documentation for all the decorators included in this addon.
