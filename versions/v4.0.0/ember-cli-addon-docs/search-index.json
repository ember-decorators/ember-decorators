They are different than standard object properties, and for good reason - to solve the \"shared state\" problem that plagues many prototypical class systems. Here's a quick example of them, and the equivalent property usage in EmberObject: const Foo = Component.extend({ prop: 123 }); class Foo extends Component { field = 123; } Fields vs. Properties Fields differ from properties in two major ways: Initialization The right-hand side of a class field expression, known as the field's _initializer_, is run every single time an instance of the class is created. This means that every instance of the class will receive a new instance of whatever value the initializer returns. This was not the case with EmberObject, which would share state with other instances of the class - the shared state problem mentioned above: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ bar: [] }); let foo1 = Foo.create(); let foo2 = Foo.create(); foo1.bar.push('baz'); console.log(foo2.bar); // will be ['baz'], because foo1 and foo2 // share the same array class Foo extends EmberObject { bar = []; } let foo1 = Foo.create(); let foo2 = Foo.create(); foo1.bar.push('baz'); console.log(foo2.bar); // will be [], because foo2 gets its own unique array Placement Fields are placed directly on each instance of a class. In other words, this: class Foo extends EmberObject { bar = 123; }Is the same as this: class Foo extends EmberObject { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.bar = 123; } }In the Ember Object model, properties that are passed into extend are not placed on the instances themselves, but the class's prototype: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ baz: 123 }); let foo = Foo.create(); foo.hasOwnProperty('baz'); // false Object.getPrototypeOf(foo).hasOwnProperty('baz'); // true Fields can be thought of as syntactic sugar for assigning values in the constructor. Field initializers are run at the beginning of the class's constructor if the class is a base class, or after the call to super if the class is a subclass. For example, the following: class Foo { foo = 123; constructor() { console.log('foo'); } } class Bar extends Foo { bar = 456; constructor() { console.log('before bar'); super(); console.log('bar'); } }Is equivalent to this: class Foo { constructor() { this.foo = 123; console.log('foo'); } } class Bar extends Foo { bar = 456; constructor() { console.log('before bar'); super(); this.bar = 456; console.log('bar'); } }This ordering becomes especially important when extending from EmberObject. Static Class Fields Like static methods, static fields can also be assigned to the class itself. This is especially useful for fields like positionalParams that had to be assigned using reopenClass with EmberObject: // before const FooComponent = Component.extend({}); FooComponent.reopenClass({ positionalParams: ['bar', 'baz'] }); // after class FooComponent extends Component { static positionalParams = ['bar', 'baz']; }Static class field initializers are only run once, since they are assigned to the constructor and not the individual instances. Using Initializers Effectively Using EmberObject, it was considered best practice to avoid shared state by either wrapping object/array/class properties as computeds, or setting them in the constructor: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ someArray: computed(function() { return []; }), init() { this.someObject = {}; this.someClass = Bar.create({ baz: this.someObject }); } })With native classes, these can now all become class fields: class Foo extends EmberObject { someArray = []; someObject = {}; someClass = Bar.create({ baz: this.someObject }); }Note that class initializers are run in order, and can refer to the instance of the class via this. This is how the initializer for someClass is able to refer to this.someObject to get the initialized value (any empty object). This pattern should be used cautiously, as it may not be immediately obvious what is happening to users who are unfamiliar with class. The behavior of initializers can also be used very effectively for binding functions to the instance, something that is commonly needed for things like event handlers. This: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ didInsertElement() { this.handleBodyClick = () => { // do something }; document.body.addEventListener('click', this.handleBodyClick); }, willDestroyElement() { document.body.removeEventListener('click', this.handleBodyClick); } });Becomes this: class FooComponent extends Component { handleBodyClick = () => { // do something }; didInsertElement() { document.body.addEventListener('click', this.handleBodyClick); } willDestroyElement() { document.body.removeEventListener('click', this.handleBodyClick); } }Note that this is still creating an instance of the event handler function _per instance of the class_, which means it incurs a much greater cost than standard methods. This pattern should only be used when binding this to the instance of the class is absolutely necessary. Initializers vs Create Properties Until recently, class field initializers would run after create parameters were assigned to the class. This meant that it was impossible to override the \"default\" values assigned in the class definition. This has since changed, and class fields will now always be assigned before create parameters, working as expected.","route":"docs.class-fields","keywords":[]},"template:docs/configuration":{"id":"template:docs/configuration","type":"template","title":"Configuration","text":"Configuration Ember Decorators can be configured to provide stricter behavior at build time.

The idea is that they transform a value in a declarative and transparent way, allowing you to write more readable and minimal code: class Foo { @readonly foo = 'bar'; @nonenumerable baz = 'qux'; @deprecate myMethod() { // ... } }Ember was written long before decorators were available, but functions like computed() and observer() are actually not much different from decorators: they receive a few keys and a function, and then return a function (or function-like object) that now watches those keys and updates or invalidates when they change. Decorators can do pretty much the same thing, but with a nicer syntax. The decorators included in the this library should enable you to write native classes with the same functionality and terseness as the Ember object-model. Some of them work very much the same as their equivalents in the standard Ember world, and some have fairly large differences. This page will cover the general decorators in some depth, and for more details you can refer to the API documentation. If you are interested in how decorators work under the hood, head over to the . Computed Properties Computed properties are the most different in behavior from standard Ember computeds. The differences come from the decision to bring CPs inline with native Javascript getter/setter syntax: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ bar: computed('baz', { get() { return this._bar; }, set(key, value) { return this._bar = value; } }) }); // becomes import { computed } from '@ember-decorators/object'; class Foo extends EmberObject { @computed('baz') get bar() { return this._bar; } set bar(value) { this._bar = value; } }There are two major differences between the standard computed and the decorated version: Setter signature The setter in standard computed properties receives both the key and the value as parameters, but this is illegal in native setter syntax - setters must receive exactly one param, the value to set. Setter return value Native setters do not need to return a value at all, and do nothing with the return value if it exists. By default, the @computed decorator automatically calls the get function in the setter to match this behavior. You may optionally return a value and @computed will cache this value as it did before, which may be useful for expensive computed properties. Aside from these differences, computed properties work the same as before. You must still use set to update their values or invalidate their caches when setting a dependent key. If you are on Ember > 3.1, you'll be able to rely on native getters to get their values, otherwise you will have use get. The standard Ember computed property macros have been recreated as decorators as well. Specifics on their usage can be found in the API docs. Actions The @action decorator can be used on any class method to turn it into an action: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ actions: { handleClick() { // ... } } }); // becomes import { action } from '@ember-decorators/object'; class FooComponent extends Component { @action handleClick() { // ... } }It's important to note that the method does not get moved to the actions hash of the object. This means that action names can conflict with existing hooks such as click or didRender, and can conflict with arguments that are passed into a class: class FooComponent extends Component { @action didRender() {} // This will collide with the didRender lifecycle hook @action click() {} // This will collide with the standard click handler // An onClick action argument onClick = null; @action onClick() {} // This will collide with the onClick argument } Observers and Events Observers and events listeners can be added with the @observes and @on decorators: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ bar: observer('baz', function() {}), initialize: on('init', function() {}) }); // becomes import { observes, on } from '@ember-decorators/object'; class FooComponent extends Component { @observes('baz') bar() {} @on('init') initialize() {} }One major difference here comes from extending classes which have observers and event listeners. Previously, if you overrode a property that was an observer on the superclass, it would be removed from the subclass. With native classes and decorators you must manually remove these with @unobserves and @off respectively: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ bar: observer('baz', function() {}), initialize: on('init', function() {}) }); const BarComponent = FooComponent.extend({ bar: null, initialize: null }); // becomes import { observes, unobserves, on, off } from '@ember-decorators/object'; class FooComponent extends Component { @observes('baz') bar() {} @on('init') initialize() {} } class BarComponent extends FooComponent { @unobserves('baz') bar; @off('init') initialize; } Injections Services and controllers can be injected via the @service and @controller decorators: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ bar: service() }); const FooController = Controller.extend({ bar: controller() }); // becomes import { service } from '@ember-decorators/service'; import { controller } from '@ember-decorators/controller'; class FooComponent extends Component { @service bar; } class FooController extends Controller { @controller bar; }You can also pass the name of the service or controller as the first parameter to the decorators: class FooComponent extends Component { @service('bar') barService; } class FooController extends Controller { @controller('bar') barController; }The decorators will attempt to inject based on the field name if no name is provided. Component Decorators Ember components have several special properties which can be used to customize the component's element and template: layout tagName classNames classNameBindings attributeBindings While these will eventually be removed from the framework, they are still necessary today. tagName and layout cannot be set directly on the instance of the class, and the others can be but won't work properly because the are concatenated properties - they get merged with the value of their parent class: const FooComponent = Component.extend({ classNames: ['foo'] }); const BarComponent = Component.extend({ classNames: ['bar'] }); console.log(BarComponent.prototype.classNames); // ['foo', 'bar']Instead, you can replace these with decorators: import layout from './template'; const ListComponent = Component.extend({ layout, tagName: 'ul', classNames: ['list-reset'], classNameBindings: ['collapsed', 'isEmpty:hidden'], attributeBindings: ['ariaRole', 'isTesting:data-test-list'] collapsed: false, isEmpty: false, ariaRole: 'list', isTesting: false }) // becomes import template from './template'; @layout(template) @tagName('ul') @classNames('list-reset') class ListComponent extends Component { @className collapsed = false; @className('hidden') isEmpty = false; @attribute ariaRole = 'list'; @attribute('data-test-list') isTesting = false; }@layout, @tagName, and @classNames are class decorators because they directly customize the component element. @className and @attribute allow you to decorate properties directly, instead of having declare the bindings in a separate place. Data Decorators Decorators exist for DS.attr, DS.hasMany, and DS.belongsTo: const User = Model.extend({ name: attr(), email: attr('string', { default: 'example@gmail.com' }), avatar: belongsTo('image', { async: false }), posts: hasMany }); // becomes class User extends Model { @attr name; @attr('string', { defaultValue: 'example@gmail.com' }) email; @belongsTo('image', { async: false }) avatar; @hasMany posts; }They should work the same as their non-decorator counterparts in general. Types and options can be passed into the decorator directly, or they can rely on reflection of the field name they are decorating.","route":"docs.decorators","keywords":[]},"template:docs/index":{"id":"template:docs/index","type":"template","title":"Quickstart","text":"Quickstart Installation First, install the package: ember install ember-decoratorsThis will add the package, and should also add several babel packages to your app. You should see the following added to you package.json: \"ember-decorators\": \"{{latest version}}\", \"@ember-decorators/babel-transforms\": \"{{latest version}}\", \"babel-eslint\": \"{{latest version}}\",And in your .eslintrc.js, you should see the following line added: parser: 'babel-eslint',These packages and settings are necessary for babel and eslint to understand decorators and class fields and correctly transpile/lint them. Usage Now that the main ember-decorators addon is installed, you can import any of the decorators from its sub-addons. The core of Ember Decorators consists of many smaller addons namespaced under the @ember-decorators scope on NPM, including: @ember-decorators/component @ember-decorators/controller @ember-decorators/data @ember-decorators/object @ember-decorators/service Now you can write Ember using native classes! For example, this: import Ember from 'ember'; export default Ember.Component.extend({ foo: Ember.inject.service(), bar: Ember.computed('someKey', 'otherKey', function() { var someKey = this.get('someKey'); var otherKey = this.get('otherKey'); return `${someKey} - ${otherKey}`; }), actions: { handleClick() { // do stuff } } }) Turns into this: import Component from '@ember/component'; import { action, computed } from '@ember-decorators/object'; import { service } from '@ember-decorators/service'; export default class ExampleComponent extends Component { @service foo @computed('someKey', 'otherKey') get bar() { const someKey = this.get('someKey'); const otherKey = this.get('otherKey'); return `${someKey} - ${otherKey}`; } @action handleClick() { // do stuff } }The packages in ember-decorators are setup to mirror Ember's javascript module API. Decorators can be imported from the packages that they belong to: import { attr, hasMany, belongsTo } from '@ember-decorators/data'; import { controller } from '@ember-decorators/controller'; import { action, computed, observes, readOnly } from '@ember-decorators/object'; import { alias, or, reads } from '@ember-decorators/object/computed'; import { service } from '@ember-decorators/service';For a more detailed breakdown on the differences between native classes and the Ember object model, continue on through the guides.","route":"docs.index","keywords":[]},"template:docs/native-class-basics":{"id":"template:docs/native-class-basics","type":"template","title":"Native Class Basics","text":"Native Class Basics If you aren't familiar with native class syntax, it's recommended that you read up on them. The MDN documentation is a good starting point, covering all the basics. This guide will highlight the differences between EmberObject and class syntax. This page covers the basics of class definition, constructors, and method definition - all things that are supported by the class keyword as of ES2015. Subsequent pages cover and in depth. If you are interested in how decorators work under the hood, head over to the . Definition When defining classes with EmberObject, we call what is effectively a static class method, .extend(), and pass in an object with properties and methods: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ // ... })When using native syntax, we instead use the class/extends keyword pair: class Foo extends EmberObject { // ... }That's the only difference. Under the hood, both native classes and EmberObject rely on standard prototypical inheritance, making them interoperable. Note: You can omit the class name from native classes, e.g. class extends EmberObject. While this is possible, it is not recommended. Giving your classes names will give them actual names in the JS vm, meaning that name will show in the console and developer tools instead of (unknown mixin) or the name that the container gives them. In the future, this will make debugging and analyzing your app easier. Extending native classes with .extend() In versions of Ember that support native classes, you can extend interoperably back and forth between native classes and EmberObject style extends: class Foo extends EmberObject { // ... } const Bar = Foo.extend({ // ... }); class Baz extends Bar { // ... } Creation When creating classes that extend from EmberObject, you should continue to use the factory methods (e.g. .create()): class Foo extends EmberObject { } let foo = new Foo(); // bad let foo = Foo.create(); // goodThis still works because .create() is a static method, which is discussed in more detail below. EmberObject still does some vital things under the hood during class creation, and creating objects with new is not considered public API. When creating classes that do not extend from EmberObject, you should use new as you would normally. Constructor vs init In EmberObject, we use the init as the constructor of the object: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ init() { this._super(...arguments); // do things } });With native classes, we also have the option to use the constructor: class Foo extends EmberObject { constructor() { super(...arguments); // do things } }While this is possible, certain values such as service injections and create parameters will not be available during the constructor phase of class creation. It is therefore recommended that you continue to use init for the time being as you transition to native classes that extend from EmberObject: class Foo extends EmberObject { init() { super.init(...arguments); // do things } }Native classes which do not extend from EmberObject do not have an init hook, and should use constructor instead: class Foo extends Object { constructor() { super(...arguments); // do things } } Methods Methods are defined and used in almost exactly the same way as before: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ doSomething() { // ... }, doSomethingTwice() { this.doSomething(); this.doSomething(); } }); class Foo extends EmberObject { doSomething() { // ... } doSomethingTwice() { this.doSomething(); this.doSomething(); } }Note that you do not need to put a trailing comma after methods. Using super When calling super, you must also name the method you want to call on the superclass: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ doSomething() { this._super(); } }); class Foo extends EmberObject { doSomething() { super.doSomething(); } }If the method was not defined on the superclass, this will throw an error. Static Methods Static methods (or properties) refer to methods placed directly on the class constructor, rather than the instance of the class. For instance, .extend and .create are static methods: let obj = EmberObject.create(); // Invoked on the class definition obj.create(); // `create` is undefined, doesn't exist on the instanceWith EmberObject, in order to add static methods or properties to a class you had to use the reopenClass static method: const Foo = EmberObject.extend({ // ... }); Foo.reopenClass({ bar() { console.log('static method bar called'); } }); Foo.bar(); // 'static method bar called'With native classes, this can be done directly in the main class definition using the static keyword: class Foo extends EmberObject { static bar() { console.log('static method bar called'); } // ... } Foo.bar(); // 'static method bar called' Accessors You can use native accessor methods (getters and setters) on classes as well: class Foo extends EmberObject { get foo() { return this._foo; } set foo(value) { this._foo = value; } }Native getters and setters are recomputed every time they are run, and have no way of sending property change notifications, which makes them less useful than computed properties for many things. @computed was made to wrap native getters and setters, meaning that any accessor can be converted into a computed property by decorating it. This is discussed more in the section on . Lifecycle Hooks Lifecycle hooks are plain old methods, and the same differences in method usage apply to them: const Foo = Component.extend({ didRender() { this._super(...arguments); } }); class Foo extends Component { didRender() { super.didRender(...arguments); } } When To Extend EmberObject In many existing Ember apps and addons, it is not uncommon for every single class to extend from EmberObject and use the Ember Object Model. This is due to the fact that many features such as computed properties, observers, etc. were not usable with native classes in an ergonomic way, until now. Now that native classes are usable with these features, the vast majority of classes outside of the standard Ember constructs such as Components, Routes, and Controllers, should not need to extend from EmberObject. Instead, you should define your classes without extending from any base class: // before const TreeNode = EmberObject.extend({ children: null, init() { this._super(...arguments); this.children = this.children || []; } }); let tree = Tree.createNode({ children: [TreeNode.create()] }); // after class TreeNode { constructor(children = []) { this.children = children; } } let tree = new TreeNode([new TreeNode()]); As a rule of thumb, in a modern Ember app written with only native class syntax: You should never be extending EmberObject directly. Only the following classes need to be extended, because they are framework classes: Component Route Controller Helper Model You should never have to use .create(). Only framework objects need to extend EmberObject, and the container always creates those.

However, there are times when we have had to make changes due to the design constraints of decorators. @reads and @overridableReads In Ember, there are several different computed property macros which can be used to alias an existing property: Ember.computed.alias: Provides a bi-directional alias (both get and set) Ember.computed.readOnly: Provides a one-way, read-only alias. Getting the computed will retrieve the value of the aliased property, but setting it will throw an error. Ember.computed.oneWay: Provides a one-way, overridable alias. Getting the computed will retrieve the value of the aliased property, but setting it will override the alias and set it to the new value. When this is done, the alias is destroyed entirely, and all subsequent changes must be made by setting the computed. Ember.computed.reads: The same as oneWay. There is also a modifier for computed properties, readOnly(), which can be used to mark a computed as read-only: prop: computed('anotherProp', function() {}).readOnly(), aliased: alias('anotherProp').readOnly(),Because this modifier was chained onto the definition of a computed, the difference between the modifier and the macro was always clear. In the world of decorators, however, modifiers like readOnly are much more naturally implemented as their own decorator: @computed('anotherProp') @readOnly prop() {} @alias('anotherProp') @readOnly aliased;This is problematic, because it would force users to constantly rename either the modifier or the macro whenever both were imported in the same file. So, we made the decision to rename the macro. Unfortunately, the strongest choice for the rename was @reads, which was already taken. With that in mind, we considered the following points: There are no other good names for a one-way, read-only alias. @readOnly is usually the behavior developers want. The overridable nature of reads/oneWay is actually extra behavior that they should opt into, not opt out of. If confusion were to arise and developers were to use @reads thinking it was the same as Ember.computed.reads, they would be opting-in to a strictly safer alias. This means there is no chance of introducing unintended behavior to code, only minor headaches as developers retrain their muscle-memory to use the new decorators. Neither @reads nor @oneWay describe the overridable nature of the alias in a semantically meaningful way. And came to the conclusion that @readOnly should be renamed to @reads, and @reads/@oneWay should be renamed to something more meaningful - @overridableReads. This difference can be confusing at first, but shouldn't be too problematic in the long run. For transitioning old code, we are at work on a codemod which will take the renames into account.","route":"docs.notable-differences","keywords":[]},"template:docs/specs":{"id":"template:docs/specs","type":"template","title":"Specs","text":"Specs Ember Decorators follows the current decorators \"stage 2\" proposal specs.

We aim to maintain a stable API as decorators and class fields evolve through the TC39 process. This means that we will not make major breaking changes to our APIs unless absolutely required by changes in the underlying spec. Class fields are currently stage 3 in the process and decorators are currently stage 2. Stage 4 marks completion, and the closer a spec is to stage 4, the more stable it is. We have recently updated to the stage 2 transforms, and are cross-compatible with the stage 1 transforms so libraries using either can interoperate (for a slight runtime cost). Browser Support Ember Decorators supports the same browser versions that Ember 3 does, IE11+ and the last two versions of every major browser. Ember Support Ember Decorators currently actively supports Ember versions which support native classes. The first version that officially ships native classes is 3.6, and there is a polyfill which works on 3.4 and 3.5. Prior versions of Ember will still work with decorators, but it is not recommended that you attempt to adopt them, since there have been major changes to the way classes work since native classes shipped. Support for earlier versions of Ember may be added at some point in the future, please open an issue on the polyfill repository if you would like support added for a particular version. Typescript Support As of ember-cli-typescript@2.0, Typescript in Ember is now being compiled using Babel, which allows you to use the same stage 2 transforms in Typescript as you would in a normal Javascript app. Installing @ember-decorators/babel-transforms should work as expected, and all decorators should operate the same. Standard Typescript decorators will continue to work using their stage 1 transforms. Support will be phased out in ember-decorators@v4, along with support for stage 1 transforms in general.","route":"docs.stability-and-support","keywords":[]},"template:docs":{"id":"template:docs","type":"template","title":null,"text":" ","route":"docs","keywords":[]},"template:docs/what-is-ember-decorators":{"id":"template:docs/what-is-ember-decorators","type":"template","title":"What is Ember Decorators?","text":"What is Ember Decorators? Ember Decorators is a project dedicated to exploring and unlocking usage of native classes in Ember.js. Its goal is to provide a set of decorators which can be used to write classes with every standard feature that is available in the standard Ember object-model, along with the transforms and build system required to polyfill and ship them today! Why do I need decorators to use native classes? Native classes have been around since ES2015, so why haven't we been able to use them with Ember all this time? While class syntax has existed for a long time now, using it with Ember was difficult because it lacked a way to: Declare properties and give them values, e.g. Ember.Object.extend({ foo: 123, classNames: ['is-active'] }); Specify meta behavior declaritively for methods, getters, setters, and properties. This is something the Ember object-model has supported out-of-the-box since the early days with computed properties, observers, event listeners, and so on, e.g. Ember.Object.extend({ foo: computed('qux', { get() { return 123; } }), bar: observer('qux', function() { // do something }), baz: on('init', function() { // do something else }) }); Class fields and decorators solve each of these problems respectively, and give us the tools to do a nearly 1-to-1 conversion from the old Ember objects to native classes. While it is technically possible to use native classes without class fields or decorators, the DX of doing this is incredibly low - its a long, error prone, and somewhat non-performant process.","route":"docs.what-is-ember-decorators","keywords":[]},"template:docs/why-go-native":{"id":"template:docs/why-go-native","type":"template","title":"Why Go Native?","text":"Why Go Native? The Ember object-model has served Ember well over the years, and really was a solid foundation during the early years of the framework being built on ES5 only. Now that native syntax has finally almost caught up feature-wise though, switching to native classes will unlock a number of major benefits, including: Integration with the Javascript community The Ember object-model was never picked up outside of the Ember community, and the wider Javascript community has continued to evolve their own standards, libraries, and practices. As classes solidify into a first class feature of the language, they will continue to gain usage, with more and more supporting libraries, frameworks, and code written for them. Ember is all about shared solutions, and standard native classes will allow us to share a solution with the entire Javascript community. Lower teaching cost The Ember object-model is a stumbling block for new users of Ember because its not Just Javascript. It requires learning a class definition and inheritance structure, a mixin system, and a whole bunch of gotchas. As native classes grow in adoption, Javascript developers in general will become more familiar with them by _default_, and there will be many resources teaching them how classes, fields, and decorators work. All of this lowers the cost of hiring and training new developers. Better tooling from editors Modern text editors like VSCode and Atom have been adding more and better support for things like autocompletion, method signature reference, go to definition, and general IDE like behavior. These features can increase developer productivity by a huge margin, making it easier to find docs, look up APIs, and catch errors and bad practices early with static analysis. Better tooling in general Other tools will be able to leverage a common class framework, leading to even more shared solutions for tooling and other repetitive work. A great example of this is ESDoc, which is the documenter that generates our API docs! It can infer much more about your classes than traditional documenters like JSDoc and YUIDoc because it reads native class syntax: // YUIDoc /* A foo class @class Foo @extends Bar */ const Foo = Bar.extend({ /* A property @property prop1 */ prop1: 123, /* A method @method doSomething */ doSomething() {} }); // ESDoc /* A foo class */ class Foo extends Bar { /* A property */ prop1 = 123; /* A method */ doSomething() {} }The two above examples would produce exactly the same documentation! ESDoc doesn't requires tags most of the time, allowing you to write code without worrying about maintenance.
